#  Oath of the dev
1. I will have my browser developer console open at all times
2. I progress with small steps
3. I will write lots of console.log statements to undertand and debug `code`
4. If it doesn't work, delete and backtrack to a working point, then rebuild
5. Research questions systematically
6. I will use the network tab of the dev tools to ensure both front and backend
   are talking
7. I will keep an eye on the server making sure that data sent there is
   actually saved
